# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to integrate datasets from citibike, yelp and foursquare to uncover patters and relationships between bike sharing stations and nearby point of interests


## Process
### step1: Installation of libraries
### step2: Getting API keys for City Bikes API, Yelp API and Foursquare API
### step3: Parse data
### Step4: Joining data
### step5: Exploratory data analysis using follium maap
### step6: Create SQLite database and store the data you've collected on the POIs
### step7: Building a model

## Results
Yelp has provided better coverage in terms of quantity of POI, It has more information on rating and reviews and offer detailed addresses. 

## Challenges 
Understanding and combining multiple APIs required and how they work.
Deciding how to overlay different dataset and handling visualization. 

## Future Goals
Add more categories of POIsÂ§
Extend analysis to other cities with bike-sharing networks
